# Utala: KAOS 9

*A 2-player tactical grid combat card game.*

---

# Objective

Be the first player to achieve **3 Rocketmen wins in a row**  
(horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

If no player achieves 3-in-a-row after all combat resolves,  
the player controlling the **most squares** wins.

---

# Components

- One standard 52-card deck
- One token (Use a Joker or coin)
- A 3×3 grid (real or imagined)

---

# Card Roles

## Rocketmen (2–10)
- Units placed on the board.
- The card number = its **Power**.
- Cards **2, 3, 9, 10** are placed face-down when deployed.

## Weapons (A, K, Q, J)
- Each player has 4 weapons.
- Single use only.
- When first played in a dogfight → **Rocket (attack)**.
- When played in response → **Flare (defense)**.
- All ranks are interchangeable.

## Kaos Deck
- Each player has their own A–K suit (A = 1).
- Shuffled at setup.
- Used to resolve combat.
- Discard pile remains face-up and visible.

---

# Setup

1. Each player chooses a suit.
2. Take from that suit:
   - Rocketmen (2–10)
   - Weapons (A, K, Q, J)
3. Choose a different full suit (A–K) as your **Kaos deck**.
4. Shuffle Kaos decks separately.
5. Decide first player.
6. Give the Joker token to one player (typically Player 2).

---

# Phase 1: Placement

Players alternate turns placing one Rocketman on any empty square.

Rules:
- 2, 3, 9, 10 must be placed face-down.
- A square may contain one Rocketman from each player (contested).
- No combat occurs during placement.
- Continue until all 9 squares are filled.

---

# Phase 2: Dogfights

A dogfight occurs in every contested square.

Resolve one square at a time.  
(Recommended order: center → edges clockwise → corners clockwise.)

Flip any face-down cards in that square before resolving.

---

# Dogfight Resolution

## Step 1 – Determine Acting Order

- Lower Power (the **underdog**) acts first.
- If equal Power → **Joker holder acts first**, then passes the Joker to opponent.

---

## Step 2 – Weapon Exchange

### Round 1 – Underdog
- Play a weapon (Rocket), or
- Pass.

### Round 2 – Opponent
If attacked:
- Play weapon (Flare), or
- Pass.

If underdog passed:
- May attack (Rocket), or
- Pass.

### Round 3 – Counter (if needed)
If opponent attacked in Round 2:
- Underdog may defend (Flare), or
- Pass.

If both players pass without weapons → proceed to Kaos Resolution.

---

## Step 3 – Weapon Outcomes

### 🚀 Undefended Rocket
Attacker draws 1 Kaos card.

- 7–13 → **Hit** (target removed, dogfight ends)
- 1–6 → **Miss** (weapon discarded, continue to Kaos)

### ⚔ Rocket vs Flare
- Both weapons discarded.
- Proceed to Kaos Resolution.

---

## Step 4 – Kaos Resolution

Each remaining Rocketman draws 1 Kaos card.

**Total Power = Rocketman value + Kaos value**

- Higher total wins the square.
- Losing Rocketman is removed.
- Tie → both Rocketmen removed.

---

# Winning

After each dogfight resolves:

- If a player has **3-in-a-row**, they win immediately.

If all dogfights resolve with no 3-in-a-row:

- Player controlling the most squares wins.
- Equal control → draw.
