    "**Utala: KAOS 9** is a tactical 3×3 grid combat game:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Placement Phase**: Take turns placing your 9 rocketmen (cards 2-10) on the board\n",
    "   - Cards 2, 3, 9, 10 are placed face-down for deception\n",
    "   - Contest opponent squares for tactical advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dogfight Phase**: Resolve contested squares through turn-based combat\n",
    "   - Use your 4 weapons (Ace, King, Queen, Jack) strategically\n",
    "   - Underdog acts first\n",
    "   - Draw Kaos cards (1-13) for resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Win Condition**: Get 3 in a row, or control the most squares\n",

    "\n",
    "This is **Phase 1** of a game AI research project:\n",
    "- Pure Python implementation (no ML frameworks)\n",
    "- Deterministic game engine with explicit RNG\n",
    "- Baseline agents to establish skill ceiling\n",
    "- Full test coverage (79 tests, 94% coverage)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project ethos:** Understanding algorithms by building them, seeing how different approaches *think*, learning by stripping problems down to their **nuts and bolts**.\n",
